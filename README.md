## About The Project

This is the first project from The Odin Project Front End Development Course. Which is you must create a landing page from scratch with the knowledge you had gain from the curriculum.


What did I gain from this project?:

* I've understand the usage of flexbox in css.
* The basic of css (It's easy for now haha).
* Satisfaction when you had done a complete landing page from scratch.
* Search for a solution in other css/html sources.



## What's next?

Now it's time to move into other lesson which is "JavacScript Basics"

Wish me luck cheers.
